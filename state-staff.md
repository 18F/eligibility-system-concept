Imagine that you ran a company that had recruited a workforce that was knowledgable, passionate, and driven by your company's mission. You'd want to provide them with tools that empower them to deliver excellent services to your customers.

We've recruited and hired just such a workforce across the country in state health and human services agencies and yet we provide these folks with cumbersome, out-dated tools to do their work, yet the persevere, sharing workarounds and lumbering through inefficient and demoralizing processes because the mission is important.

The tools eligibility workers, their managers, and those who lead public assistance administration in states use should empower these civil servants to serve their clients more efficiently and effectively. Their tools should be intuitive and smart. They should allow these important people to be able to achieve their mission. They should reduce uncertainty in the process and get people enrolled to receive the benefits they are due. They should be more holistically integrated. They should make data intelligence easy, allowing the programs to evolve and improve.

All too often, existing systems that workers must use are outdated, laborious, and hard to use. The state systems have too many responsibilities; are asked to do too many things. States don’t have the resources or expertise to make these systems modern, usable, and empowering. It’s unreasonable to ask states to continuously improve their systems based on continuous user feedback loops. We’ve learned incumbent vendors are not incentivized to build great experiences for workers.

It doesn’t have to be this way. The tools workers use can make the worker experience more gratifying and effective, can make the management of state teams easier, and can make needed reporting simple. But it requires new operating models, more de-coupling of pieces, more integrated, more shared services, and ongoing support and development.
The State E&E App that is mocked-up here shows what such an app could look like. It illustrates how applicant data for multiple users could be collected, reviewed, and processed within a power-user interface.
