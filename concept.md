# Introduction

Much of the technology that people use to access safety net programs and States use to administer those programs is aging and crumbling, despite significant significant spending and effort to modernize.

**Our current approaches to fixing this situation play right into government’s weaknesses.**

We ask over-stretched, insufficiently technical state staff to modernize massively complex computer systems by adhering to federally-provided checklists and oversight regimes, working with massive vendors through multi-year contracts worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.

But states are not well positioned to build software, modernize legacy systems, productively manage vendors, easily comply with oversight, or deliver timely and trustworthy data. Federal agencies are not well positioned to quickly drive change in the market or provide technical oversight that accelerates modernization rather than impedes it.

The way we approach technology for safety net programs forces states to dwell on their weaknesses, buckling under the weight.

**We need to move to a position of strength** if we are to repair these aging systems to deliver the services people need and Congress has defined.

**This piece attempts to envision a position of strength.** This position of strength includes:

- An eco-system of loosely-coupled products, services, and data powers rapid modernization and ongoing evolution across states _(rather than disconnected, proprietary, monolithic systems)_
- Effective federally-built software is available for states to use (rather than every state building every part)
- Eligibility policy is delivered as functional code _(rather than just written guidance)_
- Client data is secure, structured, and API-accessible _(rather than locked in inaccessible databases)_
- Client experiences are intuitive, appropriate, and empowering _(rather than opaque and demoralizing)_
- State staff have tools that help them help them achieve their mission _(rather than just compliance)_  

**By developing these strengths at the federal level, we can create tools states would _choose_ to use because they are preferable and allow them to focus on service delivery and meeting the needs of the people who need the services.**

That’s the whole point, after all.

> _Please note: Big, grandiose concept pieces like this are always wrong. Or rather, they get a lot of things wrong. The point is not to get everything exactly right, but to move the conversation along and attract participation in rethinking broad assumptions and conventions._

### Inside this concept

[**Exhibit A: An ecosystem of products**](#exhibit-a-an-ecosystem-of-products) - Recent work on the applicant experience has largely figured out what applying should look like.

[**Exhibit B: Client experiences**](#exhibit-b-client-experiences) - Recent work on the applicant experience has largely figured out what applying should look like.

[**Exhibit C: A general model for data collection**](#exhibit-c-a-general-model-for-data-collection) - A look at how we might receive data from clients, use it to find programs that can meet their needs, and make data reporting easy.

[**Exhibit D: Eligibility rules as a service**](#exhibit-d-eligibility-rules-as-a-service) - Recent work on codifying program policy into rules that can be accesses via web services has shown the feasibility of the approach.

[**Exhibit E: State Eligibility & Enrollment App**](#exhibit-e-state-eligibility--enrollment-app) - A concept for what a tool that empowers eligibility workers to meet their mission could look like.

[**Exhibit F: Models for building products**](#exhibit-f-models-for-building-products) - A look at how we might shift our system development models to more efficient, less redundant, more successful methods of production.

[**Exhibit G: Design systems**](#exhibit-g-design-systems) - Government design systems have defined good practice for how public-facing systems should look and function.

# Exhibit A: An ecosystem of products

### The current organizing principles around eligibility systems needs to change.

We should shift away from single state-based, monolithic (in both the architectural sense and the de facto monolithic nature of dependency on a single locked-in vendor), disconnected, does-everything state systems towards a more interconnected ecosystem of loosely-coupled products, each part with focused responsibility and capable ownership, connected with APIs, creating usable experiences designed around the needs of their users.

The diagram below can be used as a map to explore this piece. The ecosystem described below is in no way complete, but describes what’s covered in this piece.

**Clients experiences** - Clients apply, submit documents, have visibility into status, notices/notifications, through government and non-government channels - See sections:
