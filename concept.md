# Introduction

Much of the technology that people use to access safety net programs and States use to administer those programs is aging and crumbling, despite significant significant spending and effort to modernize.

Our current approaches to fixing this situation play right into government’s weaknesses.
States are not well positioned to build software, modernize legacy systems, productively manage vendors, easily comply with oversight, or deliver timely and trustworthy data.

Federal agencies are not well positioned to drive change in the market in a timely fashion or provide meaningful technical oversight. 

Yet the entire way we approach technology for public assistance / safety net programs forces states to dwell on their weaknesses, buckling under the weight.

We need to move to a position of strength if we are to repair these aging systems to deliver the services people need and Congress has defined.

This piece attempts to envision a position of strength. This position of strength requires the development and alignment of a number of individual strengths, most of which we (18F, CMS, FNS) have been working on. These include: building federal products for states to use, delivering policy in functional code, buying development services well, streamlining oversight. Others need attention: defining authorities and financial support.

By developing these strengths at the federal level, we can create tools states would choose to use because they are preferable and allow them to focus on service delivery and meeting the needs of the people who need the services. That’s the whole point, after all.

_* Please note: Big, grandiose concept pieces like this are always wrong. Or rather, they get a lot of things wrong. The point is not to get everything exactly right, but to move the conversation along and attract participation is rethinking broad assumptions and conventions._

# An ecosystem of products

**The current organizing principles around eligibility systems needs to change. We should shift away from single state-based, monolithic (in both the architectural sense and the de facto monolithic nature of dependency on a single locked-in vendor), disconnected, does-everything state systems towards a more interconnected ecosystem of loosely-coupled products, each part with focused responsibility and capable ownership, connected with APIs, creating usable experiences designed around the needs of their users.**

The diagram below can be used as a map to explore this piece. The ecosystem described below is in no way complete, but describes what’s covered in this piece.
